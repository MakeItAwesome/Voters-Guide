# Voters Guide
votersguide.co - A website that focuses on making voters' choices accessible by design.

## Milestones
- [x] **v0:** Users can easily reference PROS and CONS of each prop _for SF only_
- [x] **v1:** Users can easily save their choices for later (and decide whether their choices are OK to display publicly)
- [ ] **Nov 6th, 2018: ELECTIONS HAPPEN** We get useful feedback on the design of our app 
- [ ] **v2:**  Add support to other cities and counties + Allow users to follow other users (+clone their endorsements)
