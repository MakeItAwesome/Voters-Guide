# Voters Guide
votersguide.co - A website that focuses on making voters' choices accessible by design.

## Milestones
**v0:** Users can easily reference PROS and CONS of each prop _for SF only_
**v1:** Users can easily save their choices for later (and decide whether their choices are OK to display publicly)

**Nov 6th, 2018: ELECTIONS HAPPEN**
--> We get useful feedback on the design of our app (which is the pain point we set out to solve in the first place)

**v2:** 
- Add support to other cities and counties
- Allow users to follow other users

Examples:

## Model

(Proposition)[/models/proposition.js]
(User)[/models/user.js]:
